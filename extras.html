        <h1>Extras</h1>
        <p>This website will completely stop working in 75 years.</p>
        <p>The program that checks whether or not it is a Square Day takes the year and subtracts 2000</p>
        <img src="code.png">
        <p>That means that after the year 3000, the code will no longer be able to detect square days.</p>
        <p>This is provided that this website stays up and hosted, the code is still able to run, and we still have simmilar programming infrastructure to today.</p>
        <br>
        <b><p>As of today - May 5th, 2025 - there are only 4 more Square Days left before this website is defunct.</p></b>
